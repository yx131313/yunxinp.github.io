title: Ikigai by Hector Garcia and Francesc Miralles (part 1)
---

*In part 1, I'll be summarizing all the takeaways I've garnered, while part 2 will contain more of my personal input and insight from the book. It's been so impactful that I had no choice but to split it into two parts!*

This was, hands-down, one of the books that has resonated with me the most so far. 

The concept of ikigai involves finding happiness and meaning, through the intersection of four spheres in our lives: what we love doing, what we are good at, what the world needs us to do, and what we can be paid to do.

The importance of finding meaning and constantly engaging in some activity is underscored by the following quote:

>> If you don't do anything, death comes for you.

Having visited a village in Japan called Ogimi, where its inhabitants are known for their longevity, the authors proposed that the greatest secret to longevity is **keeping busy**, particularly with something that we love doing.

There are so many concepts and ideas proposed in this book that have inspired me in some way or another -- simply summarizing it in this post wouldn't be able to sufficiently bring out how in awe I was after finishing it!

## Overall Thoughts/Takeaways
### On change
* Do not fear change, especially large changes. In fact, taking a big step to change and better our lives is often much more effective than making many small tweaks or improvements.
* Leading on from this, you SHOULD aim to fulfill the seemingly impossible (known as **Shinkansen objectives**). Write down a wild dream/aspiration you've had, followed by 10 actions/initiatives you can undertake to achieve this Shinkansen objective. **State explicitly how, what and when** you will do this.

>> We have to wipe our gaze clean of 'impossibilities', as we would a steamed-up window, before setting off on our way to the summit. Because the impossible is, in reality, a mental label, a deceptive filter before our eyes.

and another quote:

>> There is nothing more enjoyable than doing the impossible. ~Walt Disney

* To encourage ourselves, we can **set a weekly objective** to do at least one thing that we thought we were utterly incapable of doing.
* Additionally, make a list of everything we thought was impossible but ended up successfully doing.

* Stepping out of your comfort zone in small ways to build your confidence and morale
	* Change your route to work or to your study centre, or opt for a walk rather than a car ride
	* Learn something new
	* Read a book by an unknown author
	* Stroll through a neighbourhood where you have never been
	* Open yourself to new friendships 

>> "Doing things that are uncomfortable and new ultimately expands your comfort zone. It enables you to confront new tasks courageously -- not without fear, but with fear under control." ~ Dale Carnegie

- Applying *kaizen* -- change for the better-- through the PDCA circle (Plan, Do, Check, Action)
- Negative motivation:
	- List three concrete changes you want to make in your life
	- Write a sentence next to each explaining why you need to make this change -- make sure it is STRONG enough to motivate you to take a step for change!
	- Visualize what your future will be like if you do not make this change
	- Every month, review your success in implementing these changes -- why did you manage/not manage to make it a reality?

### On cultivating skills
The concept of perseverance in Japanese is pretty admirable. *Ganbarimasu*, literally translated, means "be stubborn and determined until you achieve what you aimed to do".

>> Patience without action leads to a passive life. Patience with perseverance leads to us fulfilling our goals.

* The 10,000 hour rule: To become a master at a skill, practise it for 10,000 hours. If you practise 8 hours a day for 5 days a week, it would take 5 years to achieve this goal; if you practise just an hour a day for 5 days a week, it would take 40 years! (Achieving mastery is not easy.)
* Other than intensive practice, it is essential to develop **opportunity-seeking prowess**: identifying opportunities for us to exhibit and potentially boost our abilities further.
* Getting useful feedback is also crucial for us to ensure we are on the right track. Ask others **what they like the least** and **what they like the most**. But remember to ignore criticism from those who know less about the subject than you do.
* Avoid self-criticism especially when you are first starting out -- "the best creations emerge when you stop the constant analysis and self-criticism". Consider how you have made possible previous "impossibilities" and use that as a boost of confidence! :)

And a concrete step I hope to take:
- Reading the biographies or interview transcripts of those I admire/those who inspire me

Back to summarizing my takeaways:
- Being bored is a key motivating factor to start working. After that, routine and perseverance is what will take you through the rest of the process.
- For creative work especially: imitating others is a wonderful starting point! A template recommended by the book:
	1. Examine a piece that has left a strong impression on you and take notes about its strong points
	2. Detect the flaws and weak points
	3. "Import improvements from other works" 
	4. Create a piece free of the flaws you identified earlier


* *Gasshuku*/Shinkansen sessions: similar to Deep Work sessions; gathering with those who study or have similar hobbies in a place far away from your common meeting location (e.g. a hotel, a country home), and dedicate a full weekend to to practising the skill

>> Being outside our comfort zone, away from our everyday worries, helps us to concentrate our energies on getting the best out of ourselves and on learning much faster.

### On time management
>> "Divide your life into ten-minute units and sacrifice as few of them as possible to meaningless actvity." ~Ingvar Kamprad, founder of IKEA

* The Pareto principle (80/20 Rule): 
	*  80% of the time you only wear 20% of the clothes in your closet (i.e. please clear out your closet). Similarly, you only use 20% of your possessions so you should probably get rid of/throw/donate/sell the rest.
	* 20% of the people closest to you bring you 80% of your personal satisfaction (Devote more time to this happy minority!)
	* Only 20% of the things you do make you happy. So eliminate the rest and focus on delving into those that truly bring you joy! :)
* Parkinson's Law: your task expands to fill the time you have allocated to it.

>> The less time you have to do something, the more you will focus on doing what is important and seeing it through, on account of the pressure.

Less is more. 

>> "You can have any color car you like, so long as it's black." ~Henry Ford

### On cultivating values
* Benjamin Franklin's method of setting a value he would focus on each week, and starting the day with an action related to that value (e.g. gratitude: writing a letter to express your thanks to someone who has helped you)
* Making a chart and placing a check when you have demonstrated that value for the day


### On finding your Ikigai and searching for happiness
- Leave behind your modesty and insecurities, and find out what comes naturally to you
- Be confident in yourself and actively seek to improve your capabilities

* Reflect on your childhood aspirations and dreams -- write it all down on a piece of paper.
	* Ask yourself: which three childhood dreams have I still not made come true? What can I do now and in the future to make this dream take shape?
* Look back: what were the moments in life when you felt the happiest or the most fulfilled? (List it out, WRITTEN.)
	* Which of your current projects can you embark on to make you feel that same happiness again? Then "throw yourself into that adventure. Do it for the sake of your future memories."
* Stay away from those who spread negativity or are constantly complaining

>> A child's mind is free of the bonds imposed by the pressure we see ourselves subjected to once we join adult society. This free spirit is a powerful trigger for creativity.

- Watch the lecture by Randy Pausch: "Achieving Your Childhood Dreams", or transcribed: "The Last Lecture"

- Follow your instincts.
	- Uncertainty is scary, but we need to trust that everything will make sense in the future.
	- Steve Jobs felt lost during his days as a student, and never dreamed that enrolling in calligraphy classes would help him create the font for MacOS

>> "You have to trust in something -- your gut, destiny, life, karma, whatever. Because believing the dots will connect in the future will give you the self-confidence to follow your heart even wehn it seems things are not going well. And that is what will make all the difference in your life." ~Steve Jobs

>> Having to take a detour to achieve what we want often enables us to admire the most beautiful parts along the way.

An exercise:
1. What has been the most important event in your life in the last 5 years?
2. What happened before that? Which people, which actions and which other dots led to this one of your life events materializing?
3. What happened next?
4. Now, write the story of your last 5 years based on how the fundamental dots in your life joined for you to be here today.
5. Creating new dots for the future: What are you devoting most of your time and effort to right now? Do you know what fruit that will bear in the future?
6. Is there something that you have been wanting to do for some time but don't do because you are afraid of failing or of it being of no use to you?
	1. Do the latter i.e. 6 over 5 for some time, and don't worry if there are no immediate results -- in the end, the dots will join.

#### Retracting to the simple life
- Going analogue: there is a beauty in opting against the digital options
	- Using a film camera forces you to take time to appreciate the beauty around you and be more selective in the shots you choose to take. "Breathe in, appreciate and feel the moment and capture this feeling in the photograph."
		- Helps you be more relaxed and engaged --> freeing up your mental energies for your ikigai :)
	- Spend a day or two away from your devices!
	- Get a notepad that fits in your pocket and carry it with you everywhere.
	- Get a printed novel rather than an electronic book.
	- Get a vinyl record player!

- Focus on quality over quantity
	- Fewer clothes but ones that last longer 
	- Fewer tasks and more leisure time
	- Fewer friends but ones who care about us more
	- Making the most of our time for the few things that matter the most to us

- Opt for physical, real-life interactions over virtual interactions!

#### Being mindful and deriving satisfaction
- Avoid faltering and multitasking: leaving a task and coming back to it often leaves you fatigued
	- Give one task your undivided attention: e.g. leave your cell phone away from the table when you are eating, and focus on savouring the food, or e.g. enjoy a stroll as if it were the most important stroll in the world

>> "Be happy in the moment, that's enough. Each moment is all we need, not more." ~Mother Teresa

#### Finding happiness by spreading happiness
- Carry out random acts of kindness!
	- Compliment someone :)
	- Send an affectionate message to your close friends (whom you may have forgotten to express your appreciation to over time)
	- Have a coffee with the shyest one in the entire friend group -- they're the ones who need it the most
	- Take a day off and go on an unforgettable adventure/outing with a friend (especially one who is feeling down)

>> You do not fight violence and hate with more of the same, but with random acts of beauty and kindness, which achieve the exact opposite of war -- making love grow exponentially among people.

>> What you give, you give to yourself. What you do not give, you give up." ~Alejandro Jodorowsky"

- Physical touch: greet your loved ones with a hug or a kiss, regardless of how much of a rush you are in! And make it a habit to greet people with a hug.
	- Speak affectionately, appreciatively and gratefully with the people near you! "Beautiful words also caress."

- Focusing on filtering what we HEAR, SEE and SAY:
	- HEAR: Try not to listen to the negativity spread by others -- preserve the potential we have to continue doing good deeds and spreading kindness
	- SEE: Focus our attention on what is useful and beneficial for everyone
	- SAY: Don't spread or pass on others' criticism and negativity!

## On serendipity (my favorite chapter)
>> "Look for something, find something else, and realize that what you've found is more suited to your needs than what you thought you were looking for." ~Lawrence Block

* Add unexpected and random events to your plans, because planning does not always produce the best results -- the greatest discoveries were made out of sheer chance
* Say "yes" more often and actively step out of your comfort zone -- you never know if you'll find the inspiration you'll need by doing so

>> Creating serendipity requires **dynamism**. We have to get out and about and be active to provoke situations where the number of things we do not control or have not planned is high enough for the fortunate accident to take place.

* Publish more on social media networks
* Send a message or email to someone who inspires you (e.g. the author of your favorite book)
* Make yourself a business card (as is a common practice in Japan) -- if someone gives you their card, write them an email the next day
* Ask for help to do something you would normally not need help to do.
* Read a book from a genre or on a subject you would never normally read.
* Study a new discipline, or pick up a skill that you're completely unfamiliar with. e.g learn a new language, practise a different sport
* **Do something you have never done before**

- Don't keep yourself restricted with immense structure and planning.
>> "Human beings are always caught up in the balancing act of the inner conflict of wanting both freedom and control at the same time... Finding the balancing point between control and uncertainty where we feel comfortable is an important key to self-fulfilment."
>> An excess of planning can kill the most vibrant passion, whereas uncertainty brings us surprises every day.

>> Be patient, and allow things to happen in their own good time, without forcing them.

## On the power of words
- Use phrases that show how decision-making is under YOUR control
	- i.e. "I'm going to" instead of "I'd like to", "I wish to", "If only I could"
- The power of written words: Write a **personal contract** where you'll commit to carrying out some activity on a daily basis, and get someone to sign it. **Read your commitment every day for the next 21 days**
	- Edgar Dales's Cone of Learning: you remember 10% of what you read, but 70% of what you say and write! (and 90% of what you do)
- Giving your projects a meaningful name -- use words that **resonate strongly**! (e.g. Hemingway Session for writing, Buffett Plan when working towards improving your finances)

- Create a logbook of your life (which I've started doing!) Write in it on a daily basis, and compile what you're grateful for, as well as something wonderful that happened that day
- Write haikus (in the present tense, involving one of the five senses, relevant to the nature or the seasons, and express your observation or astonishment).
	- Review your haikus every 30 days -- they probably are hinting at what you value and love, or where your life is headed


## Finally, the Ikigai exercise...
- Create a small table with four squares, and fill up each section with: 
	- What you love doing
	- What the world needs
	- What you can be paid for
	- What you are good at (regardless of what others say!) + what you would like to be good at in the future

- Take action! Keep trying, keep persevering and being tenacious -- **action comes before passion**.

>> You do not need anyone's permission (to take action) -- it is your life.

- Underline whatever you have not been devoting enough time to recently
	- For each neglected thing: list out three concrete actions you will take from today onwards to reawaken these forgotten aspects of your life!

>> Once we have corrected our direction, we will realize that the fear of change was much greater than the change itself... Change your direction if you need to! Life is too short to be stuck in a desert.

Most importantly,
>> Get rid of unnecessary stuff or take new actions, but do not stand sill. Nothing new or exciting will happen if you do not take steps to make it happen.
